1️⃣ Project Overview
Project Title:

- > AI-Powered Cloud Intelligence Platform for Cost Governance and Sustainable Infrastructure Management

Project Type:

- > Cloud-native web application with AI-driven predictive analytics and sustainability modeling.

Primary Domain:

- > Cloud Engineering (AWS-focused)

2️⃣ Problem Statement

With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, organizations often experience uncontrolled cloud spending and inefficient resource utilization. Existing monitoring systems provide descriptive metrics but lack predictive intelligence and sustainability-aware optimization capabilities. There is a need for an AI-driven cloud governance system that integrates with AWS to forecast costs, detect inefficiencies, and estimate carbon impact for sustainable infrastructure management.

3️⃣ Project Objectives

The system aims to:

1.Integrate with AWS APIs to fetch real infrastructure and billing data.
2.Store historical usage metrics for analysis.
3.Predict future cloud costs using machine learning.
4.Detect underutilized resources and recommend optimization.
5.Estimate carbon footprint of compute usage.
6.Provide a combined performance evaluation score.
7.Deploy the system using secure cloud-native architecture.

4️⃣ System Scope

Included Scope:
- > AWS EC2 integration
- > CloudWatch metric collection
- > Cost Explorer API integration
- > Automated daily data collection
- > Predictive cost forecasting
- > Optimization logic
- > Carbon estimation modeling
- > EC2 + RDS deployment

Excluded Scope:
- > Multi-cloud integration
- > Kubernetes orchestration
- > Cross-account IAM role management
- > Deep learning models
- > Enterprise-level SaaS scaling
- > This ensures controlled complexity.

5️⃣ Core System Pillars
Cloud Engineering Layer:
- > AWS API integration
- > Secure IAM configuration
- > Automated scheduler
- > Cloud-native deployment

AI & Predictive Intelligence:
